## Inline code
The `<b>` tag in html can be used to make a text bold .

To escape backticks, use double backticks. ``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

## Codes

1.  Instruction 1.
2.  Instruction 2:
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>
        <html>

3.  Instruction 3.

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by two tabs.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

## Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
